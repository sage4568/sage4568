Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
my name is **sagal abdifatah**, a second-year computer science student passionate about creating innovative solutions through **cybersecurity**, and **software engineering**.
I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and make a meaningful impact.

### My Story
I started my journey in technology with a deep curiosity about how software works and quickly discovered my love for programming.
Along the way, I developed strong skills in problem-solving, teaching, and collaboration. I enjoy helping my peers understand complex concepts, and I thrive in environments where creativity and logic come together.

### Projects Iâ€™ve Made:
- *EVC-PLUS (Python):*  
  A project that simplifies mobile money transactions, such as sending, withdrawing, and checking balances,
  built with Python to enhance my programming skills and focus on real-world solutions.

- *Electronic Online Shop (C++):*  
  A basic e-commerce platform created in C++ that allows users to browse products, add items to a cart,
  and complete purchases. This project helped me strengthen my object-oriented programming (OOP) skills.

- *Student Management System (Python):*  
  A Python-based system to manage student records, including adding, updating, and deleting information.
  This project was an excellent opportunity to practice data manipulation and file handling.
- *Number Guessing Game (Python):*  
  A fun and interactive game where the user guesses a randomly generated number. This project was a great way to practice logic implementation and user interaction in Python.

### Skills and Strengths:
- *Problem-Solving:* I enjoy tackling challenges and finding efficient solutions.  
- *Teaching:* I have a knack for explaining concepts clearly and helping others succeed.  
- *Adaptability:* I quickly adapt to new programming languages and technologies.  
- *Creativity:* I love generating new ideas and bringing them to life.  

### Goals:
1. Build a strong foundation in **tech**.  
2. Work on projects that enhance my coding and teamwork skills.  
3. Secure an *international internship* to gain global experience and broaden my professional horizons.

### Fun Facts:
- Iâ€™m always excited to learn something new and challenge myself.  
- I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy brainstorming innovative solutions.
